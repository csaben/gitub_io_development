# gitub_io_development
flask application for quickly iterating my github.io page


used this as starter code but haven't finished it:
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-make-a-web-application-using-flask-in-python-3

The main issue is that I don't want to have this type of blog setup, I have a mental image of what I want but it would require me to get into the flask framework more
which isn't what I want to do right now
